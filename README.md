# :pushpin: Clean Code (by Uncle Bob)

Hello! Diego here,

When I'm programming I always think about how a **person** will understand my code, not the machine. This is the key to writing better code. In this repository I bring 10 phrases by Robert C. Martin that match this thought.


**“I’m a programmer. I like programming. And the best way I’ve found to have a positive impact on code is to write it.”**  

**“You should plan on working 60 hours per week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career.”**  

**“Any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organisation’s communication structure.”**  

**“It is not enough for code to work.”**  

**“You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.”**  

**“Say what you mean. Mean what you say.”**  

**“Yet attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. First, it is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large. Second, the smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor, or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole. That is what clean code is about.”**  

**“The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who hope one day to discover a mathematics that does not have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create machines that can do what we want rather than what we say. These machines will have to be able to understand us so well that they can translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs. This will never happen.”**  

**“You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.”**  

**“Perhaps you thought that “getting it working” was the first order of business for a professional developer. I hope by now, however, that this book has disabused you of that idea. The functionality that you create today has a good chance of changing in the next release, but the readability of your code will have a profound effect on all the changes that will ever be made.”**
